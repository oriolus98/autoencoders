# Autoencoder as anomaly detection method
I use different autoencoder architectures implemented with tensorflow as dimension reduction and anomaly detection methods. Following the paper ['Postulating Exoplanetary Habitability via a Novel Anomaly Detection Method'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02273.pdf), we assume that non-habitable planets are very usual. Thus, we may be able to detect habitable planets as anomalies from data coming from the PHL-HEC dataset. This assigment was proposed on my Deep Learning course at Data Science Master from Universitat de Val√®ncia.
